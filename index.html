                    people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to 
                    speak during the day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written 
                    songs that make the minstrels weep.

                    So begins a tale unequaled in fantasy literature- the story of a hero 
                    told in his own voice. It is a tale of sorrow, a tale of survival, a 
                    tale of one man’s search for meaning in his universe, and how that 
                    search and the indomitable will that drove it, gave birth to a legend.

                <li>"Patrick Rothfuss gives us a fabulous debut, standing firmly on the main stage of the fantasy genre and needing no warm-up act. Jordan and Goodkind must be looking nervously over their shoulders!" <br> <span>-Kevin J. Anderson, New York Times bestselling coauthor of HUNTERS OF DUNE</span></li>
                <li> This is a magnificent book, a really fine story, highly readable and engrossing. I compliment young Pat. His first novel is a great one. Wow!" <br><span>-Anne McCaffrey</span></li>
                <li>"No ordinary fantasy full of pointless quests and overblown drama. Rather, it is a finely tuned coming-of-age story, full of humor, action and the occasional dose of magic." <br><span>-The San Francisco Chronicle</span></li>

            <h2>About the author</h2>
            <p>Patrick Ruthfuss was born in Madison, Wisconsin and studied at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. Starting out as a chemical engineer, Ruthfuss jumped major to major until graduating with his Bachelors of English after nine years of study. Ruthfuss would eventually go back to teach English part time while speaking to publishers for his first title known only as “The Book” at that time. A chapter from this book did eventually make its way to the submission files of the 2002 Writers of the Future competition where it took first place.  This was the driving force that led Ruthfuss to the necessary contacts to publish the book in three parts, the first released in 2007 called “The Name of the Wind.”</p>
